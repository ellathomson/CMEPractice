% check_elements is used to keep track of which elements in the matrix v
% will need to be checked to determine whether they are critical. If an aj is
% negative the entire row for that reaction will be zeroed. If Vij is
% positive, then the one element will be zeroed.

% tested later

% negative Vij's will have a 1 in check_element, positive Vij's will have a
% 0 in check_element

% The goto variable will be an output that is used in the main SSA program
% to determine whethe to go to the tau leap generation for critical
% equations or for no critical equations. If it is 0 it means there are no
% critical reactions, if it is 1 there are crtical equations. The rjs
% values will also be outputed to detect which reactions are critical
